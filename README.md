# ScoreProphet

ScoreProphet is a private World Cup 2026 prediction app. Players predict match outcomes, exact scores, and knockout advancing teams; admins sync fixtures from football-data.org, enter or override results, and recalculate points.

Players compete inside managed championships. A user can belong to multiple championships, and one prediction set counts in every championship where that user is a member. Admins can also assign Championship Managers who manage specific championships without receiving full admin access.

## Stack

- Next.js App Router
- React 19
- Prisma 7 with SQLite and `better-sqlite3`
- `iron-session` cookie sessions
- Tailwind CSS
- Vitest

## Environment

Create `.env` from `.env.example` and set:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
FOOTBALL_API_KEY="..."
ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="at_least_6_chars"
SESSION_SECRET="at_least_32_characters_random_string"
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

`ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are used only when registering the initial admin account. A matching username/password pair creates an admin user; later logins do not promote users based on the shared password.

`APP_URL` is used when generating absolute invitation and password-reset links. If omitted, ScoreProphet falls back to the current request host.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db" npx prisma migrate dev
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db" npm run sync
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Validation

```bash
npm test
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Scoring

- Exact score: 5 points
- Single result: 3 points
- Double chance: 1 point
- Correct knockout advancing team: 1 point

Predictions lock at kickoff. Users may reset predictions for a match until kickoff.

Prediction, Results, and Leaderboard pages are championship-scoped. Users without an active championship membership only see Home, Tournament, and Teams.

## Admin Flow

Admins can:

- Create and manage championships
- Assign users to championships
- Assign Championship Managers to specific championships
- Generate and revoke championship invitation links
- Sync fixtures and teams from football-data.org
- Override final scores
- Select the advancing team for knockout matches
- Recalculate all finished-match points
- Remove non-admin users

Sync updates mutable fixture fields such as team names, crests, stage, group, kickoff, status, and scores.

## Championship Managers

Championship Managers are assigned by admins per championship. One user can manage multiple championships, and manager access does not grant global admin permissions.

Managers can open `Manage` in the navigation and, for each assigned championship:

- Add or remove championship members
- Generate invitation links for registered users
- Revoke active invitation links
- Enable or disable the championship
- Enable or disable Double Chance scoring

Managers only manage championships they are assigned to. They can participate in a championship only if they are also added as a member.

## Invitation Links

Generated invitation links open `/register?next=/invite/[token]`. A visitor must be signed in before accepting the invitation; the login and registration pages preserve the invite destination through the `next` query parameter. When accepted, the link adds the registered user to the linked championship and selects that championship for the session.

Invite tokens are stored hashed in the database. Invitation links are single-use: a successful acceptance deletes the invite. Active invitation links can also be revoked from the championship management page.

## Deployment

The Docker image runs Prisma migrations, attempts a fixture/team sync, then starts the standalone Next.js server.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The Compose file stores SQLite data in the `scoreprophet_data` volume at `/data/scoreprophet.db`.
